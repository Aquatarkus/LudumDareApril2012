Turtles All the Way Down
========================

Turtles All the Way Down is a god game where you're trying to save people from themselves. They live on a block of land precariously balanced on the back of a bemonocled turtle, and as they build houses and reproduce, they start tipping the landmass over. Your job is to hurl meteors to try to keep it in balance.

The game was built over a weekend for Ludum Dare 23, in JavaScript with three.js and Box2DJS. More details on the [Ludum Dare entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=13006). Or just [play it now](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27151004/LudumDare/Turtles.html)! (Chrome recommended, and start with the volume low unless you hate your ears.)

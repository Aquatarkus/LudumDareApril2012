In case we need it again, for quick ref when you commit:

i = insert text, ESC when done
:wq = save and quit

GIT Quick ref:

git add (file or folder name)
git commit -a (quick commit changed files)
git push (push files after you "git commit" locally, so we can see them)
git pull (get latest changes from the remote repository)
git dongs -inmymouth (prints ascii dicks)

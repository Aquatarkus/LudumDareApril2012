In case we need it again, for quick ref when you commit:

i = insert text, ESC when done
:wq = save and quit

GIT Quick ref:

git add (file or folder name)
git commit -a (quick commit changed files)
git push (push files after you "git commit" locally, so we can see them)
git pull (get latest changes from the remote repository)
git dongs -inmymouth (prints ascii dicks)

DEALING WITH CROSS-ORIGIN ERRORS IN CHROME:

When running the project on localhost (from a folder) chrome will complain that the image resources on textures violate cross-origin policy.  To resolve this, do either one of two things:

1) Run chrome with the argument '--allow-file-access-from-files'
2) Run the project over a web server.
